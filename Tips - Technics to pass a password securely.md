# technics to pass a password securely

## 1 - Using plaintext passwords (not recommended!)

With this method this create a PSCredential Object
The PSCredential object is a combination of the user account and the password

````powershell
$Account = "MyDomain\MyAccount"
$AccountPassword = "123456" | ConvertTo-SecureString -AsPlainText -Force
$Credentials = New-Object System.Management.Automation.PSCredential($Account, $AccountPassword)
````

and for later use, export it to a file

````powershell
$Credentials | Out-File -FilePath c:\temp\credential.txt
````

or

````powershell
$Credentials | Export-Clixml -Path c:\temp\credential.xml
````

### USEFUL AND PRACTICAL : Naming with User and computerName

````powershell
$Credentials | Export-Clixml -Path "C:\Temp\Credential_${env:USERNAME}_${env:COMPUTERNAME}.xml"

$Credentials
UserName                               Password
--------                               --------
MyDomain\MyAccount System.Security.SecureString
````

- Biggest advantages : The file contain password, AND Domain\account or machine\account
- Biggest drawback   : 100% INSECURE!!!
- Limitation         : Only use on the same account on the same computer

## 2 - Enter the password interactively (Read-Host)

With this method this create a PSCredential Object
The PSCredential object is a combination of the user account and the password

````powershell
$Account = "MyDomain\MyAccount"
$AccountPassword = Read-Host -AsSecureString
$Credentials = New-Object System.Management.Automation.PSCredential($Account, $AccountPassword)
$Credentials

UserName                               Password
--------                               --------
MyDomain\MyAccount System.Security.SecureString
````

and for later use, export it to a file

````powershell
$Credentials | Out-File -FilePath c:\temp\credential.txt
````

or

````powershell
$Credentials | Export-Clixml -Path c:\temp\credential.xml
````

- Biggest advantages : Easy to implement and 100% secure.The file contain password, AND Domain\account or machine\account
- Biggest drawback   : can only be used when running the PowerShell script interactively.
- Limitation         : Only use on the same account on the same computer

## 3 - Using a 256-bit AES key file and a password file

With this method this create a ````PSCredential```` Object. The PSCredential object is a **combination of the user account and the password** but to use it with another account on another computer it was salted. When you use this method you will generate two files :

- 256-bit AES key file
- a password file.

These files can than be used in your PowerShell scripts on local and remote computers.

### Read the secure password from a password file and decrypt it to a normal readable string

````powershell
$SecurePassword = ( (Get-Content $PasswordFile) | ConvertTo-SecureString -Key (Get-Content $KeyFile) ) # Convert the standard encrypted password stored in the password file to a secure string using the AES key file
$SecurePasswordInMemory = [Runtime.InteropServices.Marshal]::SecureStringToBSTR($SecurePassword)       # Write the secure password to unmanaged memory (specifically to a binary or basic string)
$PasswordAsString = [Runtime.InteropServices.Marshal]::PtrToStringBSTR($SecurePasswordInMemory)        # Read the plain-text password from memory and store it in a variable
[Runtime.InteropServices.Marshal]::ZeroFreeBSTR($SecurePasswordInMemory);

````

In the above code we use the ````Marshal class```` to write the secure password to unmanaged memory. We than read this unmanaged memory and store the password in the variable ````$PasswordAsString````. You can test if this variable contains the correct password by adding a simple write-host command :

````powershell
Write-Host "Password is: $PasswordAsString"
````

- Biggest advantage  : can be used in multiple scripts on remote computers.
- Biggest drawback   : not 100% secure. The AES key file can be used to decrypt the password and therefore requires additional (NTFS) protection from unauthorized access. The file contain only password, NOT Domain\account or machine\account
- Limitation         : can be used with another account on another computer. The file contain only password, not the Domain\account and machine\account

## 4 - Use Export-Clixml

For credentials that need to be saved to disk, serialize the credential object using Export-CliXml to protect the password value.
The password will be protected as a secure string and will only be accessible to the user who generated the file on the same computer where it was generated.
The file can than be used in your PowerShell scripts on local and remote computers but only with the same machine and account that encrypt the file
Ref. : <http://www.jaapbrasser.com/quickly-and-securely-storing-your-credentials-powershell/>

### Define variables

````powershell
$Directory = "C:\temp"
$PasswordFile = Join-Path -Path $Directory -ChildPath "AllCredentials.xml" # Define a HashTable that contains multiples credentials
$Hash = @{
    Srv1 = Get-Credential -Message "Please enter the credentials for Account on SRV1 - form : Domain\Account or IP\Account or Machine\Account"
    Srv2 = Get-Credential -Message "Please enter the credentials for Account on SRV2 - form : Domain\Account or IP\Account or Machine\Account"
    Srv3 = Get-Credential -Message "Please enter the credentials for Account on SRV3 - form : Domain\Account or IP\Account or Machine\Account"
}
````

### $hash contains all credentials

````powershell
$Hash | Export-Clixml -Path $PasswordFile
````

### later you can add a new value in he hash table with the method add (key, value)

````powershell
$hash.add("Srv4" , (Get-Credential -Message "Please enter the credentials for Account on SRV3 - form : Domain\Account or IP\Account or Machine\Account"))
````

### You can use later by importing the previously saved credential

````powershell
$Credentials = Import-Clixml -Path $PasswordFile
Invoke-Command -ComputerName srv1 -Credential $Credentials.Srv1 -ScriptBlock { MyCommand }
Invoke-Command -ComputerName srv2 -Credential $Credentials.Srv2 -ScriptBlock { MyCommand }
Invoke-Command -ComputerName srv3 -Credential $Credentials.Srv3 -ScriptBlock { MyCommand }
Invoke-Command -ComputerName srv4 -Credential $Credentials.Srv4 -ScriptBlock { MyCommand }
````

- Biggest advantages : easy to implement and 100% secure. The file contain multiples passwords, AND Domain\accounts or msachine\accounts
- Biggest drawback   : Only use on the same account on the same computer
- Limitation         : Only use on the same account on the same computer, but you can generate the hash with a runas "AccountthatRunTheScheduledTask" and one limitation disappears.

## 5 - Combine Salting Method (3) and export-xml method (4) if Possible

to complete

## 6 - Use a self signed certificate

### The first thing to do is to create your own self signed certificate

````powershell
New-SelfSignedCertificate -DnsName test -CertStoreLocation "Cert:\CurrentUser\My" -KeyUsage KeyEncipherment, DataEncipherment, KeyAgreement -Type DocumentEncryptionCert

New-SelfSignedCertificate : Could not find makecert.exe. This tool is available as part of Visual Studio, or the Windows SDK.
Au caractère Ligne:1 : 1
+ New-SelfSignedCertificate -DnsName test -CertStoreLocation "Cert:\Cur ...
+ ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
    + CategoryInfo          : NotSpecified: (:) [Write-Error], WriteErrorException
    + FullyQualifiedErrorId : Microsoft.PowerShell.Commands.WriteErrorException,New-SelfSignedCertificate
````

What's wrong ?

````powershell
Get-Command *New-SelfSignedCertificate
CommandType     Name                                               Version    Source
-----------     ----                                               -------    ------
Function        New-SelfSignedCertificate                          1.3.6      PowerShellCookbook
Cmdlet          New-SelfSignedCertificate                          1.0.0.0    PKI
````

Ok, I'll use the cmdlet from the the PKI Module

````powershell
PKI\New-SelfSignedCertificate -DnsName test2 -CertStoreLocation "Cert:\CurrentUser\My" -KeyUsage KeyEncipherment,DataEncipherment,KeyAgreement -Type DocumentEncryptionCert
   PSParentPath : Microsoft.PowerShell.Security\Certificate::CurrentUser\My

Thumbprint                                Subject
----------                                -------
520CF475E13A8EC71B46D147CEE661E471A19BA5  CN=test
````

### The second step is to encrypt the password string with this newly created certificate

````powershell
"MySuperComplexPassword" | Protect-CmsMessage -To cn=test2 -OutFile C:\Temp\pwd.txt
````

You can see the content of the file, using the following command

````powershell Start-Process C:\temp\pwd.txt
# or
Invoke-Item C:\temp\pwd.txt
````

How can we decrypt the password ?

````powershell
Unprotect-CmsMessage -Path C:\Temp\pwd.txt
MySuperComplexPassword
````

You can note that the password is now in clear text.

### Now implementation in a script

When you pass credentials in a script, the requires ````SecureString````. The we'll use ````ConvertTo-SecureString```` cmdlet to convert the previous command to a SecureString

````powershell
$password = ConvertTo-SecureString (Unprotect-CmsMessage -Path C:\Temp\pwd.txt) -AsPlainText –Force

$password
System.Security.SecureString
````

And now we can use this $Password Var in the script.

````powershell
$UserName = 'Automate@MyDomain.com'
$Password = ConvertTo-SecureString (Unprotect-CmsMessage -Path C:\Temp\pwd.txt) -AsPlainText –Force
$Cred = New-Object -TypeName System.Management.Automation.PSCredential -ArgumentList $UserName, $Password

$Cred
UserName                                 Password
--------                                 --------
Automate@MyDomain.com System.Security.SecureString
````

The password is already a SecureString

Now let's use it

````powershell
$MailParams = @{
    From          = "Admin@MyDomain.com"
    To            = "AnotherUser@MyDomain.com"
    Body          = "Test Message with encrypted credentials"
    Subject       = "Test-Mail from Contact"
    SmtpServer    = 'smtp.office365.com'
    UseSsl        = $true
    Port          = 587
    BodyAsHtml    = $true
    WarningAction = "SilentlyContinue"
    }

Send-MailMessage @MailParams -Credential $Cred
````

the mail message is send using @MailParams and $Cred as credentials.

Ref. :  <https://sid-500.com/2020/05/03/how-to-secure-passwords-in-powershell-scripts/>

- Biggest advantages : Easy to implement (multi files with different names for password from different accounts). 100% secure
- Biggest drawback   : The file contain password. Only use on the same computer cause using self-SignedCertificate
- Limitation         : Only use on the same computer

### And now, full script to do this easily

This is not my script. It's a script provided by sid-500.com (URL in the script)

````powershell
''
Write-Host 'Provided by sid-500.com.'
Write-Host 'This tool protects your file content with certificates.' -ForegroundColor Green
''
$cert=Read-Host -Prompt 'Do you already have a certificate for encipherment? (Y/N)?'

If ($cert -eq 'Y')

{
''
Write-Host 'Select Certificate.'

$mycert=Get-Childitem Cert:\CurrentUser\My

$choicec=$mycert | Where-Object hasprivatekey -eq 'true' | Select-Object -Property Issuer,Subject,HasPrivateKey | Out-GridView -Title 'Select Certificate' -PassThru
''
Write-Host 'Enter path to the file to encrypt (e.g. C:\temp\pw.txt)' -ForegroundColor Yellow
''
$path=Read-Host -Prompt 'File Path'
''
Write-Host 'Please wait. Encrypting content ... Once completed notepad will open your encrypted file.'
''
Get-Content $path | Protect-CmsMessage -To $choicec.Subject -OutFile $path

notepad $path

}

If ($cert -eq 'n')

{
''
Write-Host 'This section creates a new self signed certificate. Provide certificate name.'
''
$newcert=Read-Host 'Enter Certificate Name'

New-SelfSignedCertificate -DnsName $newcert -CertStoreLocation "Cert:\CurrentUser\My" -KeyUsage KeyEncipherment,DataEncipherment,KeyAgreement -Type DocumentEncryptionCert

$cert=Get-ChildItem -Path Cert:\CurrentUser\My\ | Where-Object subject -like "*$newcert*"
$thumb=$cert.thumbprint
''
Write-Host 'Certificate created'
''
Write-Host 'Saving certificate to users profile' -ForegroundColor Green
''
$pwcert=ConvertTo-SecureString -String (Read-Host 'Enter Password for cert file') -Force -AsPlainText
''
Write-Host 'Certificate Export completed' -ForegroundColor Green
Export-PfxCertificate -Cert Cert:\CurrentUser\My\$thumb -FilePath $home\"cert_"$env:username".pfx" -Password $pwcert

Write-Host 'Enter path to the file to encrypt (e.g. C:\temp\pw.txt)' -ForegroundColor Yellow
''
$path=Read-Host -Prompt 'File Path'
''
Write-Host 'Please wait. Encrypting content ... Once completed notepad will open your encrypted file.'
''
Get-Content $path | Protect-CmsMessage -To $cert.Subject -OutFile $path

notepad $path

}
````

This script work fine.
- Biggest advantages : Easy to use.
- Biggest drawback   : The file contain password. Only use on the same computer *and* same user cause using self-SignedCertificate located in personal certificate container
- Limitation         : The computer limitation could be overpassed, if the backup certificate is installed in another computer. But always only the same user
